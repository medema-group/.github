**Welcome to the Medema Group GitHub page!**

We at the Medema research group at Wageningen University, the Netherlands, are investigating natural products, naturally occurring molecules with specialized biological activities, such as antibiotic properties.
The biosynthesis of such compounds is often organized in so-called biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), which the Medema group has a particular interest in.

We are interested in studying their occurrence, ecological functions, and purpose of these specialized metabolites in the context of drug discovery, host-microbiome interactions, and rhizosphere investigation.

For this, we build and use omics data processing tools, curate and maintain databases, and collaborate with wet-lab scientists.

Together with our collaborators, we have created numerous state-of-the-art tools, such as [antiSMASH](https://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org) and [BiG-SCAPE/CORASON](https://github.com/medema-group/BiG-SCAPE), and gold-standard databases such as [MIBiG](https://mibig.secondarymetabolites.org/) or [antiSMASH-DB](https://antismash-db.secondarymetabolites.org/).
